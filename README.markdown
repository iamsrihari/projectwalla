#  Gowalla-Basic
## A simple example iPhone App using the Gowalla API

We created this example application as a resource to help you get up to speed with the Gowalla API on the iPhone. The app implements a basic feature set, including an authentication flow using OAuth, spot search, and checking-in to nearby Spots.

As you might expect, the Core Location and MapKit frameworks are central to the functionality of the app. If you are just getting started with location programming on the iPhone, you might want to check out Apple's [Core Location Framework Reference](http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/CoreLocation/Reference/CoreLocation_Framework/index.html) and [MapKit Framework Reference Guide](http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/MapKit/Reference/MapKit_Framework_Reference/index.html) before diving in.

## Requirements

Gowalla-Basic uses iOS4 as its Base SDK, which is available to ADC Members at [http://developer.apple.com/iphone/](http://developer.apple.com/iphone/). If you are targeting a previous version of iOS, you may need to make some changes before adopting this code into your project.

## Creating Your Own Application

Gowalla-Basic comes working out-of-the-box with its own API key, secret, and callback. You can configure everything for your application with the following steps:

- Create an application at [http://api.gowalla.com/api/keys](http://api.gowalla.com/api/keys), by clicking "Add Application"
- Fill out the form accordingly.
  For <u>Callback URL</u> you will most likely want to use a custom URL scheme. This should be something unique, for example a dasherized version of your application's name (ie. my-app://callback). 
    
    **Note**: Do not use gowalla://, as this is already reserved by Gowalla for iPhone and iPad, and will cause conflicts.
- Once you've submitted your form and gotten your API credentials, open up `GowallaAPIKeys.h`. Replace all of the API constants with your own values.
- Next, open up `Info.plist`. Under "URL types > Item 0" change the identifier and scheme to match your callback URI.
- All done! If there's an existing copy of the app in the simulator, you should delete it to reset your application credentials.

## Libraries

In the spirit of not re-inventing the wheel, this project includes several external libraries for things like HTTP requests and JSON parsing. Of course, you're more than welcome to adapt this example to use your libraries of choice.

* **[EGOHTTPRequest](http://github.com/enormego/EGOHTTPRequest)** - Useful wrapper around NSURLConnection that adds many essential methods. API Requests are mediated with EGOHTTPRequest.

* **[EGOImageLoading](http://github.com/enormego/EGOImageLoading)** - "What if images on the iPhone were as easy as HTML?" Used for image loading and caching in TableViewCells and  UIViews.

* **[TouchJSON](http://code.google.com/p/touchcode/wiki/TouchJSON)** - Parser and generator for JSON implemented in Objective C. TouchJSON is used to convert JSON into NSDictionaries.
